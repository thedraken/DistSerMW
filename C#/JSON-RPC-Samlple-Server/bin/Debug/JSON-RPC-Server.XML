        <member name="F:JSON_RPC_Server.ServiceMode.DISCONNECT_BEFORE_PROCESSING">
            <summary>
            Close the connection before handling the request in any way. Please note
            that no interceptor will be called in this mode.

        <member name="F:JSON_RPC_Server.ServiceMode.DISCONNECT_BEFORE_REPLY">
            <summary>
            Close the connection after having processed the request, but before
            sending back the response. Please note that in this mode, the
            interceptor will be called for both the request as well as the response.

        <member name="F:JSON_RPC_Server.ServiceMode.RANDOM">
            <summary>
            The service mode will be determined randomly for every subsequent
            request. This includes all three other modes, i.e. RELIABLE,
            DISCONNECT_BEFORE_PROCESSING, and DISCONNECT_BEFORE_REPLY.
            Please note that by definition of the two latter modes, the
            connection will be closed in those cases. If the randomly
            selected service mode is RELIABLE, however, the next request
            will be handled in a reliable fashion, keeping the connection
            alive. For each subsequent request, a service mode will again
            be chosen randomly.
